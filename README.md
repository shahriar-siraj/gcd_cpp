# C++ program to calculate Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

## Problem:

Write a function named "reduce" that takes two positive integer arguments, call them "num" and "denom", treats them as the numerator and denominator of a fraction, and reduces the fraction. That is to say, each of the two arguments will be modified by dividing it by the greatest common divisor of the two integers. The function should return the value 0 to indicate failure to reduce if either of the two arguments is zero or negative, and should return the value 1 otherwise.
